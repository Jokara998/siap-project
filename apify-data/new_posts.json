You can sit at the bar or at a table and order drinks and pay directly from your phone. It\u2019s so easy and the service is wonderful. \n\nI tried \u201cThe Eastside\u201d and the \u201cHello Cranford\u201d. The Eastside is made from my favorite gin Hendricks, lime, simple syrup, cucumber, and mint! The \u201cHello Cranford\u201d was sooo good and  made with Tito\u2019s, St. Germain, lemon juice, grapefruit, and soda. The name is too cute!\n\nThis is such a great place to stop in for a great cocktail or glass of wine. They also have great food options like pizza and small plates because they are owned by the fabulous @wonder !!! \n\nIf you haven\u2019t been yet, stop in soon! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#njfood #njeats #njblogger #foodie #njfoodie #foodpics #instafood #foodlover  #foodblog #food #instafood #foodphotography #follow #foodblogger #like #jersey #cranford #westfield #garwood #summit #globaleats #newjerseyrestaurant #restaurant #diningout #diningoutnj #cocktails #drinks #happyhour #bar #bars",
